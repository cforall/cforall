cfa-cc: Cforall to C Trans-compiler
======================================

Cforall is built using GNU Make and the GNU Autoconf system.  It also requires
g++ version >= 6, bison and flex.  On systems where GNU Make is the default
make, the system is built by entering the commands:

For developers using the root git:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure [ --prefix=/some/directory ]
  $ make -j 8 install

For users using the distributed tarball / github:

  $ ./configure
  $ make -j 8 install

where 8 is the number of CPUs on your computer.


Options for configure
======================================
The script 'configure' accepts many command-line arguments.  Run

  $ ./configure --help

to list them.  The most common argument is:

  --prefix=/some/directory controls the path prefix common to all installed
    cfa-cc components.  Components are installed in directories bin and lib.
    If unspecified, prefix defaults to /usr/local.  To use (a subdirectory of)
    your home directory, ${HOME}/some/dir, but do not put quotes around the
    directory path; Cforall may appear to build, but the installed version may
    not work properly.


Build Test
======================================

  $ cd ./tests
  $ make -j 8 all-local

The tests take about 2-5 minutes and can be stopped at any time.
