cfa-cc: Cforall to C Trans-compiler
======================================

Cforall is built on Linux using GNU Make and the GNU Autoconf system, which
includes Windows WSL.  It also requires g++ version >= 9, bison and flex.  On
systems where GNU Make is the default make, the system is built by entering the
commands:

1. For developers using the root git:

   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ ./configure [ --prefix=/some/directory ]
   $ make -j 8 install
   $ cfa

2. For users using the distributed tarball/github:

   $ ./configure
   $ make -j 8 install
   $ cfa

where 8 or greater is the number of CPUs on your computer.

The above instructions produce an in-tree, installed build, where intermediate
binaries share the same folders as their sources, and where the final result
becomes an "official" CFA version for the current environment.  For developers
preferring an isolated side-by-side build, where all binaries are separated
from sources, where it is possible to build multiple configurations from a
common set of sources, and where no "official" CFA version is designated:

   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ mkdir ../build
   $ cd ../build
   $ ../cfa-cc/configure
   $ make -j 8
   $ ./driver/cfa


Options for configure
======================================
The script 'configure' accepts many command-line arguments.  Run

   $ ./configure --help

to list them.  The most common argument is:

   --prefix=/some/directory controls the path prefix common to all installed
     cfa-cc components.  Components are installed in directories bin and lib.
     If unspecified, prefix defaults to /usr/local.  To use (a subdirectory of)
     your home directory, ${HOME}/some/dir, but do not put quotes around the
     directory path; Cforall may appear to build, but the installed version may
     not work properly.


Build Test
======================================

   $ cd ./tests
   $ make -j 8 all-local

The tests take about 2-5 minutes and can be stopped at any time.
