cfa-cc: The Cforall->C Compiler System
======================================

Cforall is built using GNU Make and the GNU Autoconf system.  It also requires
g++ version >= 4.6, bison and flex.  On systems where GNU Make is the default
make, the system is built by entering the commands:

For devs using the maintainer's git:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

For users using the distributed tarball / github:

	./configure
	make
	make check
	make install

Options for 'configure'
-----------------------
The script 'configure' accepts many command line arguments.  Run './configure
--help' to see a list of all of them.  This document attempts to summarize the
most useful arguments.

--prefix=/some/directory controls the path prefix common to all installed
  cfa-cc components.  Some components are installed in /some/directory/bin,
  others in /some/directory/lib.  If unspecified, this defaults to /usr/local.
  To use (a subdirectory of) your home directory, ${HOME}/some/dir works, but
  it is important not to put quotes around the directory path; Cforall may
  appear to build, but the installed version may not work properly.
